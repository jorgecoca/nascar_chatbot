# 🤖🏁🏆 NASCAR Chatbot - AIM Certification Challenge

NASCAR celebrates a multitude of racing events across North America, with thousands of different guests on each race. Racing teams invite VIP guests to their team pits to enjoy the race; these VIPs are usually representatives of sponsors or other celebrities that might have a commercial interest in the race, but are not, generally speaking, well versed in the rules, regulations, history or race details of NASCAR, making their VIP experience sometimes not worth the time of the race, or not as pleasant as it could be.

We aim to create a NASCAR educational chatbot for VIP guests that can be consulted during the day of the race, at the track, to enhance their experience and increase the ROI of their sponsorship experience.
